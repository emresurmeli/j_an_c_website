      <p>
        - If you would like to venture up north, you can check out one of our favorite spots, the Big Deep Swimming Hole near Woodstock, also about 40 minutes away from Buttermilk Falls Inn. See the link below for directions but once you get there, do not stop where everyone is swimming. Keeping walking towards left following the river until you find the waterfall. Pack a picnic and enjoy!
