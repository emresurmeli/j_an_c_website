        There are many things to do in nearby area including, hiking or cycling in scenic parks, boating on the Hudson, antique hunting, swimming in pristine lakes, visiting local art galleries, touring Hudson Valley wine country and shopping at one-of-a-kind boutiques.  Below are a few of our favorites:



        Minnewaska State Park

        This park is about 40 mins drive from Buttermilk Falls Inn. The park features numerous waterfalls, three crystalline sky lakes, dense hardwood forests, incising sheer cliffs and ledges opening to beautiful views, clear streams cut into valleys, 35 miles of carriage roads and 50 miles of footpaths on which to bike, walk, hike and simply enjoy.

        Big Deep Swimming Hole
        If you would like to venture up north, you can check out one of our favorite spots, the Big Deep Swimming Hole near Woodstock, also about 40 minutes away from Buttermilk Falls Inn. See the link below for directions but once you get there, do not stop where everyone is swimming. Keeping walking towards left following the river until you find the waterfall. Pack a picnic and enjoy!
